        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
            I like to think of myself as a dog and fitness enthusiast. I started CrossFit 5 years ago and now coach to share my passion with others. You can find my dog, Paisley, and me at our local CrossFit gym most mornings.
            <br><br>
            My journey into nutrition started in high school after attending a horticultural camp in Hawaii. Since then, I've been transforming my favorite dishes into nutritious meals. My interest in cooking and baking was inspired by my grandfather, a professional chef who once cooked for the Queen of England.
            <br><br>
            Before pursuing a culinary career, I studied psychology and started a master's program in clinical mental health counseling. Although I chose a different path, the knowledge gained continues to influence my life.
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I enjoy CrossFit, cooking, baking, skiing, and traveling.

        <h2>Educational & Professional Background </h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences. My studies covered various aspects of personal health, public health, nutrition, and fitness. Afterward, I pursued my passion for cooking by attending culinary school, where I worked as a baker, pastry chef, and cake decorator.
            <br><br>
            My journey into software engineering began when I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp, completing a 500-hour training program. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Software Development at Boston University.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to create impactful solutions in the health and fitness tech industry, leveraging my diverse background and technical skills.
